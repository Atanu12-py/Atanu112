# Project Title

A brief description of what this project

## Overview

This project, named "Hit url" is a robust Spring Boot application designed for managing user data efficiently. It provides  RESTful API endpoints that allow you to perform count of hit url by the user with user name and any visitors.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Language:** Java
- **Build Tool:** Maven

### Controller

The Controller layer is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and delegating them to the appropriate services. It defines API endpoints for the following operations:

@GetMapping("count")
@GetMapping("username/{username}/count")

## Services

The Services layer implements the core business logic, data processing, and interaction with the data repository. Key responsibilities include:

@Service
public class UrlHitService {
    private int totalHitCount = 0;

    public String getHitCount() {
        incrementHitCount();
        return "Visitor:"+totalHitCount;
    }



## Repository

The Repository layer manages data access to the underlying database. It handles database operations such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) for user data. Additionally, it may include data mapping and conversion between Java objects and database entities.

private HashMap<String, Integer> userHitCountMap = new HashMap<>();
##database

**Integer totalHitCount;
**String userName;

## Data Structures Used

The project utilizes the following data structures:

#HashMap

The project utilizes the `HashMap` data structure to store and manage user with their username and total no of hit count.`HashMap` provides dynamic sizing and efficient element retrieval, making it suitable for storing user records and performing operations on them.

## Project Summary

The User Management project is a robust Spring Boot application designed for efficient data management. It offers a set of RESTful API endpoints.
